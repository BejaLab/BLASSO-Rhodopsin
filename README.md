Wrapper for BLASSO-for-Rhodopsins
=================================

The workflow provides a wrapper for the [BLASSO-for-Rhodopsins](http://www-als.ics.nitech.ac.jp/~karasuyama/BLASSO-for-Rhodopsins/) code for prediction of microbial rhodopsin absorption spectra.
All the credit goes to the authors of the original software, see [Exploration of natural red-shifted rhodopsins using a machine learning-based Bayesian experimental design](https://www.nature.com/articles/s42003-021-01878-9). BLASSO-for-Rhodopsins was downloaded from [http://www-als.ics.nitech.ac.jp/~karasuyama/BLASSO-for-Rhodopsins/BLASSO-Rhodopsin.zip](http://www-als.ics.nitech.ac.jp/~karasuyama/BLASSO-for-Rhodopsins/BLASSO-Rhodopsin.zip), archived on 2021-02-13. The original `Data` folder is located in `original/Data`, the `seqBlasso.R` script is located under `workflow/scripts/` and is used verbatim.
